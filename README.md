##Vision: 
Provide assisted expert health care to remote patients in an easy and fast way.

##Problem: 
In indian rural and semi-urban context access to quality health care is very sparse. 
Locally available doctors may not be most experienced or informed to evaluate patients medical 
condition with consistency and quality.

##Solution:

-Guide them collect most relevant examination data for the medical condition.
-Enable online review of the case with a relevant speciality expert.

System improves over time in following manner:-
-Experts update the system with more knowledge as they review the cases.
-Latest medical data curated periodically to improve examination process.
-Treatment outcomes will be feedback to the system in near realitime to finetune and localize.
